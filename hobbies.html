                I like to combine the work, having fun and a entertaining life. <br>
                I am a sports person, in my life I have practiced many sports and done a many things. <br>
                I have practiced soccer and basketball, also I have done box, swimming and currently, the gym. <br> 
                As you can see on the left of the screen, I like a lot to climb mountains and if there is water,  the better. I am always looking por a place to swim and dive,  and if it's in nature, even better. <br> <br>
                I believe that we always need to be looking for an adventure, looking for a story to tell to your sons or grandchildren, I believe that you have to live without fear, obviusly taking care of yourself but forgetting the past and don't be concerned about the future, just living the present. <br> <br>
                I like to hang out with all my people but at the same time I love to stay at home listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJNa9Ih3haA&pp=ygULbW9uZXkgdHJlZXM%3D" id="Kendrick", target="_blank">Kendrick Lamar</a> and cooking while I lose myself in the music. <br> <br>
                I hope that one day I can do all those things I mentioned, but anywhere in the world.
